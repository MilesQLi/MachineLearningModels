#Machine Learning Models


##Purpose

The origin purpose is just to practice implementing the effective machine learning models and get more insights. But maybe it will be of practical help. 

##Dependencies

I implement the models with two kinds of tools: [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/). Using theano will save a lot of work but I want to know more about the details and make them  easy to migrate to other tools like Matlab so I will implement some models using numpy too.

##Implemented
SVM,KNN,PCA,FNN,Recurent NN,LSTM,RBM

##Plan to Implement
Recursive NN, CNN
