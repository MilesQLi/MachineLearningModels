#Machine Learning Algorithms


##Purpose

The origin purpose is just to practice writing down the machine learning model. But maybe it will be of help. 

##Tool

I implement the models with two kinds of tools: numpy and theano. Using theano will save a lot of work but I want to know more about the details and make them  easy to migrate to other tools like Matlab so I will implement some models using numpy too.
